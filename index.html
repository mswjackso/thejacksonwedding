                boarding the train across from Bret Hall to our Redwoods

                standing ceremony surrounded by nature and all our loved ones.
                Limited seating available, let us know if you may need it.
              </li>
              <li>
                What to wear: Dress is semiformal and comfortable shoes (don’t
                recommend heels as you’ll be doing some walking in dirt).
              </li>
              <li>
                Reception: Reception takes place once we get back from the

              </li>
              <li>
                Navigating the Venue: From the parking lot, follow the path over the
                covered bridge that says “Roaring Camp”, (there should also be a sign
                for our wedding). Cross the railroad tracks and follow the path staying
                to the right into the town and you’ll see the hall/train station.

              <li>
                Protip: getting there early gives you time to explore this awesome park,
                there are old western stores, and across the way is Henry Cowell Redwoods
                state park where you can take a very mild 1.5mile loop through the redwoods

                    We did not reserve a room block because there are so many

                    few different options which you can see below to try and fit
                    your respective price ranges. If none of these seem to work
                    for you either then don't worry just google around. Like I

        <div class="message">
          <img src="images/red_awkward.jpg" style="float:left;"/>
          Melissa and I probably first met in freshman year of high school but it
          must not have been love at first sight because we weren't even confident
          of each other's existence until junior year of high school. We were both
          part of the same schedule of IB classes and it was there that the flirting
          first began.<br />
          <br />
          <img src="images/ib_jump.jpg" style="float:right;" />
          We tried going out once but alas, Melissa decided that she didn't like me.
          So Michael spent his time sulking around for the next year...and trying to
          date other girls. So the time came in senior year, the day of "No-E" where
          Michael bet Melissa that he could go longer without using any word with the
          letter "E" in it than she could. If he won then she would have to kiss him
          and if she won then he would have to kiss her. Easily the best bet that any
          teenage boy could ever make.<br />
          <img src="images/high_school_grad.jpg" style="float:left;" />
          <br />
          From that time onward we were pretty inseparable, walking to class together,
          doing homework together, studying for IB tests together, eating at Primo's.
          It was all awesome up until it was time to go to college. After that we had
          decided to try and see if we could handle long-distance all the while talking
          about the possibility of transferring from one school to the other. As we
          went through school we would visit back and forth every month or so and talk
          on the phone every day in order to stay in contact. We never ended up
          transferring but it may have been for the best as we grew as people both in
          the time that we did spend together as well as apart.<br />

          After college we moved in together in San Mateo up in the Bay Area just 20
          miles south of San Francisco. Melissa started her job at EY and I finished
          up my degree before starting to work at Imprivata. We continued to live
          together eventually moving farther south, and having one of my college
          friends move in with us. It was during this year that I had decided to
          propose to Melissa. I sneakily purchased a ring while her parents were in
          town to distract her and was planning on doing it during our trip to
          Germany that we had been planning for a while. I ended up doing it before
          though mainly for two reasons:<br />
          <ol>
            <li>I ate Burger King that day, which was the same place my dad proposed to my mom.</li>
            <li>
              It was Bastille Day, a holiday though slightly obscure, which I have subconsciously
              been trying to have all of our important relationship steps happen on as it makes
              remembering anniversaries easier and keeps me and my forgetfullness out of trouble.
            </li>
          </ol>
          I proposed to her at our house, the night before we were going to leave on the trip
          and we were packing all of our stuff.<br />

          <br />
          The rest is history, and so now here I am designing this website looking
          back on our past and realizing how lucky I am to of found someone who I love
          so wholeheartedly but also who loves me in return.
